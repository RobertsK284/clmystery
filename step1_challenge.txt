How can you view a file in different directory without switching to that directory first?
You can refer to the file by the relative or absolute path.
What is the difference between absolute paths and relative paths?
Absolute paths are the entire filepath from the root to the final subfolder, and they start with /.
Relative paths are a partial filepath relative to the folder where you currently are. They start with ./.
